# Decode_cipher
Brute force substitution cipher code to find all available mappings

IMPORTANT: This works for substitution cipher only !!!
this may take a long time to run, the more words your cipher code has. anywhere more than 10 words and it could take a very very very very very long time. (over 5 hours)
however, the less words you have, the more possible solutions there will be. Find a balance
